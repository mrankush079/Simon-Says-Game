# 🎮 Simon Says Game

A modern, browser-based memory challenge inspired by the classic "Simon Says" game. Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, 
this project tests users' ability to recall and repeat sequences of colored button flashes that grow more complex with each level.

## 🧠 How It Works
